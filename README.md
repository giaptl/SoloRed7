## Project Overview
**SoloRed7** is a solitaire adaptation of Red7, designed with simplified rules for a single player. The game emphasizes strategic thinking, as the player must modify both their hand and the game's rule set to meet the win conditions. This project was created to showcase skills in Java development, OOP, and test-driven design.

## Game Rules
In SoloRed7:
1. Each card has a color and a number.
2. The player modifies their hand and/or the current rule to meet win conditions.
3. **Goal:** Achieve the highest-ranking palette under the current rule.

## Features
- **Core Gameplay Mechanics:** Accurate implementation of the game's fundamental rules and player actions.
- **Flexible Rule System:** A dynamic approach to rule changes in-game.
- **Error Handling:** Robust validations for card inputs and game rules.
- **Test Coverage:** Extensive JUnit tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Tech Stack
- **Java**: Core language for game logic and rules.
- **JUnit**: Unit tests to verify game functionality and behavior.
- **Git**: Version control to track development progress.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 11** or higher installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giaptl/SoloRed7.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SoloRed7
3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main

## Architecture
The code is structured to highlight key object-oriented principles:
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:** Separate classes manage the game's model, user interface, and user input.
- **Encapsulation and Modularity:** Classes are organized by functionality, enhancing code readability and reusability.
- **Exception Handling:** Provides informative feedback on invalid inputs.

## Project Highlights
- **Game Model:** Implements a flexible, easy-to-understand model.
- **View Layer:** Simple interface for displaying the game state to the player.
- **Testing Framework:** Includes automated tests covering edge cases for gameplay, ensuring a stable and reliable game experience.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced User Interface:** Develop a GUI version for improved player interaction.
- **AI Opponents:** Expand the game with AI players to simulate a multiplayer experience.
- **Additional Game Variants:** Add new rule variations for different game experiences.
