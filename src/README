- I made all the methods in Palette public so that it could be accessed by AdvancedSoloRedGameModel
which is in a different package.
- I abstracted redundant code from SoloRedGameModel and AdvancedSoloRedGameModel into a new class
called AbstractSoloRedGameModel. So my new model classes are much shorter and just use super to call
the duplicate methods.
- I created a CardNumbers enum to store the card numbers and their values. This way the card numbers
are immutable to the user. I updated CardPiece to account for this change as well. I updated the
Abstract model class to use this enum and I also updated my tests to use this enum (instead of
hardcoding the values).
- I changed all variables named as a single character to meaningful words after Prof told us to do
so during lecture.
